# QuizBot
QuizBot acts as an AI Assistant to the teacher. Just upload your teaching material and it creates customizable 'MCQ' question sets based on teacher-selected difficulty, number of questions, and options.

## Knowledge
* **Chains** : Combination of propmt templates to run queries against an LLM where output of one component acts as an input to another.
* **Prompt templates** : help to translate user input and parameters into instructions for a language model. This can be used to guide a model's response, helping it understand the context and generate relevant and coherent language-based output.​
* Prompt Templates take as input a dictionary, where each key represents a variable in the prompt template to fill in.​

## Workflow

* File Upload
  
  Teacher uploads study material. Set parameters for number of questions, options and difficulty level.

  Tells the LLM to summarize the entire content to make reasoning easier and avoid Context Length crashes.

  Tells the LLM to generate MCQ's based on the summary and keeping in mind the parameters set by the teachers.

* Chain Visualization
